# Lab01_Report
This file contains the contains the results of the first lab exercise.

### 1. Configure Parameters
As a first example, we ran the command:

```bash
$ ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d hello_result configs/example/arm/starter_se.py --cpu="minor" "tests/test-progs/hello/bin/arm/linux/hello"
```
 
 We used the file **starter_se.py** to set the parameters of the system we want to emulate with gem5. These parameters are:
 
 - cpu: The type of CPU kernel. It can be atomic, minor or hpi.
 - cpu-freq: The CPU clock frequency.
 - num-cores: The number of CPU cores.
 - mem-type: The type of memory to use.
 - mem-channels: The number of memory channels.
 - mem-rank: The number of memory ranks per channel.
 - mem-size: The physical memory size.
 
 In our example we set the cpu parameters and leave the rest of them in their default values, as described in the **starter_se.py** file. So we expect the system to have the following features.

- Minor CPU type.
- 4GHz CPU clock frequency.
- 1 CPU core.
- DDR3_1600_8x8 memory type.
- 2 memory channels.
- None memory ranks per channel.
- 2GB memory size.

### 2. System Informations
After executing the above command, the files **config.ini**, **config.json** and **stats.txt** were created in the **hello_results** folder. The first two files contain a list of every object created for the simulation and the values for its parameters, just in different formats. The third one is a representation of all of the gem5 statistics registered for the simulation.

( a ) The file **config.ini** can verify the choices we made at the beginning, in particular:

- Line 65: type=MinorCPU defines that the CPU type is Minor.
- Line 58: clock=250 indicates that the CPU clock is set at 1000000000000 / 250 = 4GHz.
- Line 113: numThreads=1 defines the use of just one core for the execution.
- Lines 1427, 1557: ranks_per_channel=2 is the default number of memory ranks per channel. The memory channels have the names defined in line 13.
- Line 21: mem_ranges=0:2147483648 defines 2GB of memory size.

( b ) In the file **stats.txt** in line 14 system.cpu_cluster.cpus.committedInsts, shows that the number of instructions committed is **5028**.

( c ) In the file **stats.txt** in line 493 system.cpu_cluster.l2.overall_accesses::total, shows that the number of overall (read+write) accesses to L2 cache is **479**.

### 3. In-Order CPU Models
There are 4 types of in-order CPUs. In-order means that they execute the instructions by the order they arrive to the CPU.

- **AtomicSimpleCPU**
The AtomicSimpleCPU is an in-order model. It uses the latency estimates from the atomic accesses to estimate overall cache access time. The AtomicSimpleCPU implements functions to read and write memory, and also to tick, which defines what happens every CPU cycle. It defines the port that is used to hook up to memory, and connects the CPU to the cache [1].

- **TimingSimpleCPU**
The TimingSimpleCPU uses timing memory accesses. It stalls on cache accesses and waits for the memory system to respond prior to proceeding. Like the AtomicSimpleCPU, the TimingSimpleCPU implements the same set of functions. It defines the port that is used to hook up to memory, and connects the CPU to the cache. It also defines the necessary functions for handling the response from memory to the accesses sent out [1].

- **MinorCPU**
The MinorCPU is a flexible in-order processor model which was originally developed to support the Arm ISA, and is applicable to other ISAs as well. MinorCPU has a fixed four-stage in-order execution pipeline, while having configurable data structures. The four-stage pipeline implemented by MinorCPU includes fetching lines, decomposition into macro-ops, decomposition of macro-ops into micro-ops and execute. The basic characteristic of this type of CPU is that it has configurable data structures which helps in build a memory hierarchy in order to better memory access time [2].

- **HPI CPU**
High Performance In-Order (HPI) CPU is based on the Arm architecture and is built to represent a modern in-order Armv8-A implementation. One of its basic characteristics is that it uses the same 4-stage pipeline that is used in the Minor CPU. Moreover, there are separate instruction and data buses, hence an instruction cache (ICache) and a data cache (DCache). So, there are distinct instruction and data L1 caches backed by a unified L2 cache.

( a ) In this step we wrÎ¿te a simple program in C **myprog/myprog.c** that prints the odd numbers between 1 and 1000, we used the instractions to compile it for an arm processor **myprog/myprog_arm** and then we executed with the gem5.

First we ran the simulator with a **MinorCPU**, using the command:

```bash
$ ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d myprog_MinorCPU_result configs/example/se.py --cpu-type=MinorCPU --caches -c 'myprog/myprog_arm'
```

The results was saved in the **myprog_MinorCPU_result** folder, the execution took **399326000** ticks to complete.

Then we ran the simulator with a **TimingSimpleCPU**, using the command:

```bash
$ ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d myprog_TimingSimpleCPU_result configs/example/se.py --cpu-type=TimingSimpleCPU --caches -c 'myprog/myprog_arm'
```

The results were saved in the **myprog_TimingSimpleCPU_result** folder, the execution took **704536000** ticks to complete.

( b ) The results show that the Minor kernel is a lot faster than the TimingSimple kernel. This is an expected result because the Minor kernel uses a 4-stage pipeline while TimingSimple doesn't. This means that in Minor kernel while one instruction is processed by the ALU the next one can be fetched.

( c ) In order to see how different parameters affect the system, we ran the emulator with diffenert values of CPU type, CPU fequency and memory type.

- For the **MinorCPU** the total ticks, for different CPU frequencies and memory types are:

|   | DDR3_1600_8x8 | DDR4_2400_8x8 | LPDDR5_5500_1x16_8B_BL32 |
|:------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 2.0GHz | 399326000 | 398162000 | 413587000 |
| 3.0GHz | 310322367 | 308905452 | 325350657 |
| 5.0GHz | 238481200 | 237581200 | 253370200 |

- For the **TimingSimpleCPU** the total ticks, for different CPU frequencies and memory types are:

|   | DDR3_1600_8x8 | DDR4_2400_8x8 | LPDDR5_5500_1x16_8B_BL32 |
|:------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 2.0GHz | 704536000 | 704414000 | 717126000 |
| 3.0GHz | 492434073 | 491913261 | 504191304 |
| 5.0GHz | 320275000 | 319654000 | 332275000 |

As we can see, the CPU type and the frequency are the most segnificant parameters. MinorCPU is a alot faster than TimingSimpleCPU and with the increase of frequency the speed of the system rises. Also the memory type make changes in the system perfomance, too.

The results are also saved in the **myprog_CPU_FRQ_MEM_result** folder.
