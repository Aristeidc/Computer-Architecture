# Lab01_Report
**Christos Emmanouil, Chatzipemou Aristeidis**

This file contains the contains the results of the first lab exercise.

### 1. Configure Parameters
As a first example, we ran the command:

```bash
$ ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d hello_result configs/example/arm/starter_se.py --cpu="minor" "tests/test-progs/hello/bin/arm/linux/hello"
```
 
 We used the file **starter_se.py** to set the parameters of the system we want to emulate with gem5. These parameters are:
 
 - cpu: The type of CPU kernel. It can be atomic, minor or hpi.
 - cpu-freq: The CPU clock frequency.
 - num-cores: The number of CPU cores.
 - mem-type: The type of memory to use.
 - mem-channels: The number of memory channels.
 - mem-rank: The number of memory ranks per channel.
 - mem-size: The physical memory size.
 
 In the file we can also find information about the caches, every CPU model using. The atomic type seems to have no cache, the minor and hpi have L1 instractions, L1 data, walk and L2 cache.
 
 In our example we set the cpu parameters and leave the rest of them in their default values, as described in the **starter_se.py** file. So we expect the system to have the following features.

- Minor CPU type.
- 4GHz CPU clock frequency.
- 1 CPU core.
- DDR3_1600_8x8 memory type.
- 2 memory channels.
- 2GB memory size.

### 2. System Informations
After executing the above command, the files **config.ini**, **config.json** and **stats.txt** were created in the **hello_results** folder. The first two files contain a list of every object created for the simulation and the values for its parameters, just in different formats. The third one is a representation of all of the gem5 statistics registered for the simulation.

( a ) The file **config.ini** can verify the choices we made at the beginning, in particular:

- In line 13 we can see that the system has 2 memory channels.
- In line 15 we can see that the cache line size is 64.
- In line 21 the memory addresses start from 0 and ends in 2147483648. A range that corresponds to 2GB of memory.
- In line 58 we can see that the CPU clock ticks every 250 ticks of the system, so the CPU frequency is 4GHz.
- In line 65 the CPU type is MinorCPU.
- In line 116 the numThreads = 1 defines the use of just one core for the execution.
- In lines 183 and 222 we can see that the dcache size is 32768 bytes.
- In line 316 we can see the range of the walker cache.
- In line 911 the range of icache is mentioned.
- In line 929 we can see that the icache size is 49152 bytes.
- In line 1427 and 1557 the ranks_per_channel = 2 gives us the number of ranks in both channels.

( b ) In the file **stats.txt** the line 14 system.cpu_cluster.cpus.committedInsts, shows that the number of instructions committed is **5028**. Although in line 15 system.cpu_cluster.cpus.committedOps we can see that the total number of committed operations is **5834**. These numbers are differents because, in the second one, extra 806 micro operations are included.

( c ) In the file **stats.txt** the line 493 system.cpu_cluster.l2.overall_accesses::total, shows that the number of overall (read+write) accesses to L2 cache is **479**.

### 3. In-Order CPU Models
Gem5 supports, among others, in-order CPU models. In-order means that they execute the instructions by the order they arrive to the CPU. We give a small description of 3 of them:

- **AtomicSimpleCPU**
This model estimates the overall cache access time of an instruction and execute it for this period of time. The AtomicSimpleCPU implements functions to read and write memory, and also to tick, which defines what happens every CPU cycle. It defines the port that is used to hook up to memory, and connects the CPU to the cache [1].

- **TimingSimpleCPU**
The TimingSimpleCPU uses timing memory accesses. It stalls on cache accesses and waits for the memory system to respond prior to proceeding. Like the AtomicSimpleCPU, the TimingSimpleCPU implements the same set of functions. It defines the port that is used to hook up to memory, and connects the CPU to the cache. It also defines the necessary functions for handling the response from memory to the accesses sent out [1].

- **MinorCPU**
The MinorCPU is a flexible in-order processor model, has a fixed four-stage in-order execution pipeline, while having configurable data structures. Τhis hierarchy of the system leads to better memory access time [2].

( a ) In this step we wrοte a simple program in C, **myprog/myprog.c** that prints the odd numbers between 1 and 1000, we used the instractions to compile it for an arm processor **myprog/myprog_arm** and then we executed with the gem5.

First we ran the simulator with a **MinorCPU**, using the command:

```bash
$ ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d myprog_MinorCPU_result configs/example/se.py --cpu-type=MinorCPU --caches -c 'myprog/myprog_arm'
```

The results were saved in the **myprog_MinorCPU_result** folder, the execution took **399326000** ticks to complete.

Then we ran the simulator with a **TimingSimpleCPU**, using the command:

```bash
$ ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d myprog_TimingSimpleCPU_result configs/example/se.py --cpu-type=TimingSimpleCPU --caches -c 'myprog/myprog_arm'
```

The results were saved in the **myprog_TimingSimpleCPU_result** folder, the execution took **704536000** ticks to complete.

( b ) As expected the MinorCPU model is a lot faster than the TimingSimpleCPU. The hierarchy of MinorCPU enables it to be able to load a new instructions while another one is processed by the ALU.

( c ) In order to see how different parameters affect the system, we ran the emulator with diffenert values of CPU models, CPU fequency and memory type.

- For the **MinorCPU** the total ticks, for different CPU frequencies and memory types are:

|   | DDR3_1600_8x8 | DDR4_2400_8x8 | LPDDR5_5500_1x16_8B_BL32 |
|:------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 2.0GHz | 399326000 | 398162000 | 413587000 |
| 3.0GHz | 310322367 | 308905452 | 325350657 |
| 5.0GHz | 238481200 | 237581200 | 253370200 |

- For the **TimingSimpleCPU** the total ticks, for different CPU frequencies and memory types are:

|   | DDR3_1600_8x8 | DDR4_2400_8x8 | LPDDR5_5500_1x16_8B_BL32 |
|:------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 2.0GHz | 704536000 | 704414000 | 717126000 |
| 3.0GHz | 492434073 | 491913261 | 504191304 |
| 5.0GHz | 320275000 | 319654000 | 332275000 |

As we can see, the CPU type and the frequency are the most segnificant parameters. MinorCPU is a alot faster than TimingSimpleCPU and with the increase of frequency the speed of the system rises. Also the memory type make changes in the system perfomance, too.

The results are also saved in the **myprog_CPU_FRQ_MEM_result** folder.
